# CS7642_Project1

Dear Instructors and TAs:

In my github master directory you will find two jupyter notebooks.

1. If you want to generate new random walk training datasets, just copy "Project_1_new.Training.Sets.ipynb" to your local directory, and in terminal carry out the following command line:

jupyter notebook Project_1_new.Training.Sets.ipynb

2. If you want to repeat the results and figures in my report, just copy "Project_1_existed.Training.Sets.ipynb" and "trainingSets_array.npy" to the same local directory, and in terminal carry out the following command line:

jupyter notebook Project_1_existed.Training.Sets.ipynb

Let me know if I missed anything.

Best,

Zheng Fu, Ph.D.
