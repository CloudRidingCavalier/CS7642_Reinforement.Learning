# CS7642_Project3

Dear Instructors,

I put all my codes of project 3 into a jupyter notebook named “Project3.Final.ipynb”, and you could open it using Miniconda or Anaconda. The following is the environment I compile and carry out my codes without errors:

cvxopt       1.1.9

conda        4.3.34

matplotlib   1.5.3

numpy        1.12.0

pandas       0.18.1

python       2.7.12

Let me know if you have any further concerns or I missed anything.

Best,

Zheng Fu
